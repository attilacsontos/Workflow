This is a new modification. It doesn't have any conflict as it's only an addition to the existing code.

Another Attempt at cloning, this time by following instructions from this page : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/how-to/with-visual-studio-code/clone-github-repository?tabs=command-palette

It seems to be working.
