Hello Attila,

This is a first change I made on the file

Description: changed the initial text from Attila in order to see what happens with "conflicts" in the code when trying to merge.

This is a new modification. It doesn't have any conflict as it's only an addition to the existing code.

Another Attempt at cloning, this time by following instructions from this page : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/how-to/with-visual-studio-code/clone-github-repository?tabs=command-palette

It seems to be working.

Trying to see how this change is going to be authorized and tracked.
--> it's directly committed and merged. There is no validation of any kind.

Trying to do the same from VS Code (the same being checking what are the validation steps if any)
--> It's also directly committed and merged. There was no validation.

Hypothesis : the absence of merge is because it was done on the "Main" branch directly. Let see how it goes when a new branch is created.
--> It works as described in the note from Attila = push is OK, then pull request, then merge.
